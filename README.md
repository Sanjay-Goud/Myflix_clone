# netflix_clone
This project is a static Netflix clone created using HTML and CSS. It is a simple, yet effective, recreation of the
Netflix user interface, showcasing the use of modern web design techniques and responsive layouts. The clone
includes elements such as a navigation bar, movie banners, and a grid of movies, designed to replicate the look and
feel of the actual Netflix platform.
